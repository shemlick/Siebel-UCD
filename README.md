### Compatibility
	The IBM UrbanCode Deploy automation plug-in works with Siebel version 8.X.
	This plug-in requires version 6.1.1 or later of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
    
### Installation
	The packaged zip is located in the releases folder. No special steps are required for installation.
	See Installing plug-ins in UrbanCode Deploy. Download this zip file if you wish to skip the 
	manual build step. Otherwise, download the entire Siebel-UCD and 
	run the "ant" command in the top level folder. This should compile the code and create
	a new distributable zip within the releases folder. Use this command if you wish to make
	your own changes to the plugin.
